# 1. CRITICAL: USER CONFIGURATION AND PROFILES
# These files contain local paths, the currently active user, and profile data.
# They must NOT be shared on GitHub as they break the setup for others and pose a security risk.

data/profiles/*.txt
data/user.txt

# 2. GENERATED METADATA AND OUTPUTS
# These folders are created every time a user starts a practical, containing headers and output logs.
# We ignore the entire contents of the numbered directories within 'data/'.

# 3. GENERATED BINARIES AND TEMPORARY FILES
